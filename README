'roche' is a Python extension for Roche geometry allowing one
to generate arrays suitable for plotting gas streams and roche 
lobes.

Installation is the usual:

python setup.py install

but you need to have installed my C++ roche package first and defined
an environment variable TRM_SOFTWARE to point to the directory containing
lib and include which contain the libraries and include files.

Documentation available from 'pydoc roche' once you have installed
the software.
